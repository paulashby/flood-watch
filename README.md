# Flood-Watch
A 4-Member Team Project

## Description
* A dashboard where you can call -up UK flood warnings and pinpoint them on the map.
* The user can set the following user inputs as part of their search.
1. Location
2. Severity: minimum severity value.

## Installation
* This is a web based application that needs no traditional installation. Rather, you just lauch the application from within the main folder by double clicking on the index.html file which launches into the landing page.

* From this landing page, you can then have access to all the flood related data by clicking on the button functionalities or just by hovering around the  charts which will fetch you the desired information.


## User Story
* As a local authority representative, I want to know of flood warnings in advance so that I can alert residents and plan accordingly within my area of responsibility.

* As a bussiness owner working in a flood prone area, I want to check whether my staff and bussiness is at risk of an imminent flood even so I can implement an action plan.

* As a visitor to an area I want to know in advance of my travel whether there are any warnings that may affect my travel plans.
